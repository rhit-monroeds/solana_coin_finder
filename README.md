This script uses the solscan.io API to scan transfers from popular exchanges and track what the reciever does with the recently transferred funds. 

It is optimized to find insiders who are buying coins early before they become popular. For example, it found RTR, DJT, and many more tokens before they publicized. RTR went up over 100x after it was found and DJT went up over 400x.

Have fun.
